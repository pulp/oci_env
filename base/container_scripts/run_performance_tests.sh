ERROR: pytest is not installed

This usually means you did not include the "-i" flag with the oci-env "test"
subcommand. The first invocation of functional tests needs "-i" to install the
test requirements (inc. pytest). After the requirements are installed, "-i" can
be dropped from further runs on the same container instance.

ERROR: pulpcore.client.${PROJECT} is missing.

This usually means you did not run "oci-env generate-client -i ${PROJECT}" before
running the functional test command. It could also mean you did not pass the "-i"
flag to the "generate-client" subcommand which would have created the client, but
not install it into the appropriate location.
